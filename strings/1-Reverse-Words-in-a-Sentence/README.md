# Reverse Words in a Sentence
Given a sentence (an array of characters), reverse the order of words.

# Solution
 - Runtime complexity: The runtime complexity of this solution is linear, O(n).
   Position of all the elements in the sentence is changed.

 - Memory complexity: The memory complexity of this solution is constant, O(1).

The solution reverses every word in-place i.e., it does not require any extra space.

# Here is how the solution works:
 - Reverse the string.

 - Traverse the string and reverse each word in place.
