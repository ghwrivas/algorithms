# Binary Search on a Sorted Array
Given a sorted array of integers, return the index of the given key. Return -1 if the key is not found.

# Solution 1: recursive
 - Runtime complexity:    The runtime complexity of this solution is logarithmic, O(log n).

 - Memory complexity: The memory complexity of this solution is logarithmic, O(log n).

The recursive solution has O(log n) memory complexity as it will consume memory on the stack.

# Solution 2: iterative 
 - Runtime complexity: The runtime complexity of this solution is logarithmic, O(log n).

- Memory complexity: The runtime complexity of this solution is constant, O(1).

The iterative solution has the same O(log n) runtime complexity as the recursive solution but has a better memory complexity.
